#^all first scripts need this as first line

# everytime you open the IDE, need to rest directory
# in terminal, cd space first letter of directory, and then tab should generate the rest

# print('\n') = newline

# Strings:
# str() makes an integer a string, so does ""
# can't add integers and strings
# but "" is static, str() is dynamic - useful for functions, and especially when using x - "x" will generate the letter x

# tab whenever you want lines underneath main function to respond to those above (for function, if function, etc..)
# tabs and colons are buddies - if you need one you need the other!

# brackets vs parentheses:
#     brackets - for lists and for index in list
#         ie: l = [1,2,3,4]
#         print(l[2]) generates 3, since operates on a 0 index (first number is 0)
#     parenthesis are for order of operations + functions

# x can equal x+1
